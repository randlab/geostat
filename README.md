# geostat

A python library for Geostatistics. This is mainly for people
who want to understand how basic geostatistical algorithms can be implemented.

It can be used for very simple cases, but it does not contain advanced methods.

We tried to make the code as simple and clean as possible. The most expensive 
operations are based on numpy and the code is reasonably fast. However, it is
recommended to use other dedicated, optimized and professional software for
real case studies and applications.

The core functionalities are in the base.py module. Some tests and examples (notebooks
or python code) are given in the example directory.
